A notification icon should be present in the app's main interface (e.g., the top right corner or navigation bar).\n2.  The notification icon should display a visual cue (e.g., a badge with a number) when there is a new order update.\n3.  The number on the badge should indicate the number of unread order update notifications.\n\nUse Case 2\n\nUser story: As a customer, I want the notification icon to disappear or change its visual cue after I have viewed the order updates, so that I know I'm up-to-date.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n\n1.  Upon tapping the notification icon, the user should be directed to a screen displaying the order updates.\n2.  Once the user views all unread order updates, the badge on the notification icon should disappear, or the number should reset to zero.\n3.  The system should track which notifications have been viewed by the user.\n\nUse Case 3\n\nUser story: As a customer, I want to receive timely notifications about significant order events (e.g., order confirmation, preparation started, out for delivery, delivered) so that I can plan accordingly.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n\n1.  The notification icon should be triggered to update when the order status changes to one of the following states: \"Order Confirmed,\" \"Preparation Started,\" \"Out for Delivery,\" or \"Delivered.\"\n2.  Each order update should be accompanied by a push notification with a brief message describing the update.\n\nUse Case 4\n\nUser story: As a customer, I want the notification icon to be easily distinguishable and not intrusive so that it doesn't interfere with my app usage.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n\n1.  The notification icon should use a clear and recognizable symbol (e.g., a bell or an envelope).\n2.  The size and placement of the icon should be appropriate for the screen size and should not obstruct other important UI elements.\n3.

    "brd_text": "\nUse Case 1\n\nUser story: As a teacher, I want to receive a notification at the start of the class indicating the number of students present, so that I can quickly gauge attendance.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1.  A notification is sent to the teacher's device at the scheduled start time of the class.\n2.  The notification displays the total number of students marked as \"Present\" in the system at the time the notification is sent.\n3.  The notification includes the class name or ID for easy identification.\n4.  The notification appears on the teacher's mobile device (iOS and Android).\n5.  The notification is generated even if the teacher does not have the app open.\n\nUse Case 2\n\nUser story: As a teacher, I want to be able to customize the notification time, so that I can receive the attendance summary a few minutes before class starts to prepare accordingly.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1. The app settings allow the teacher to set a preferred notification time (e.g., 5 minutes before class, 10 minutes before class).\n2. The system sends the notification at the teacher-defined time.\n3. If no custom time is set, the default notification time is at the start of the class.\n4. The custom notification time setting is saved and applied to all future classes.\n\nUse Case 3\n\nUser story: As a teacher, I want the notification to update automatically if a student's attendance status changes after the initial notification is sent, so that I always have an accurate count.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1.  If a student's attendance is updated (e.g., from Absent to Present) after the initial notification, a new notification reflecting the updated count is sent.\n2.  The updated notification clearly indicates that the attendance count has changed and displays the new count.\n3.  A reasonable delay (e.g., 5 minutes) is implemented to prevent excessive notifications for minor changes.\n4.  The system should have a configuration to enable or disable real-time updates.\n\nUse Case 4\n\nUser story: As a teacher, I want to be able to view a detailed attendance report from the notification, so that I can see exactly which students are present or absent.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1.  The notification is interactive and allows the teacher to tap or click to view a detailed attendance report.\n2.  The detailed report displays the list of all students in the class and their individual attendance status (Present, Absent, Late, etc.).\n3.  The report includes the date and time the attendance was taken.\n4.  The report is accessible within the app.\n\nUse Case 5\n\nUser story: As a system administrator, I want to ensure that the notification system is reliable and scalable, so that all teachers receive notifications promptly and accurately.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1.  The notification system can handle a large number of concurrent users and classes without performance degradation.\n2.  The system includes monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and resolve any notification delivery issues.\n3.  The notification system is designed to be scalable to accommodate future growth in the number of users and classes.\n4.  Error logs capture any failure in sending notification to the teachers.\n\nUse Case 6\n\nUser story: As a teacher, I want to be able to disable notifications for specific classes, so that I am not disturbed during meetings or personal time.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1. The app provides an option to disable attendance notifications on a per-class basis.\n2. When notifications are disabled for a class, the teacher does not receive any attendance notifications for that specific class.\n3. The disabled notification setting is saved and persistent across app sessions.\n\nUse Case 7\n\nUser story: As a teacher, I want the notification to display the number of students absent as well as present, so that I have a complete overview of the class attendance.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1. The notification displays both the number of students present and the number of students absent.\n2. The notification format is clear and easy to understand (e.g., \"Present: 25, Absent: 5\").\n3. The total number of students in the class is also displayed or easily inferable from the present and absent counts.\n\nUse Case 8\n\nUser story: As a teacher, I want to be able to customize the type of notifications I receive (e.g., push notifications, email), so that I can choose the most convenient method for me.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1. The app settings allow the teacher to select their preferred notification type (push notification, email, SMS).\n2. The system sends notifications via the teacher's selected method.\n3. Clear instructions are provided on how to configure notification preferences.\n\nUse Case 9\n\nUser story: As a student, I want to receive a notification if the teacher has marked me as absent when I am present, so I can quickly rectify it.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1. If the teacher initially marks a student absent and then changes it to present, the student should get notified about the change.\n2. The notification alerts the student when their absence status is changed.\n\nUse Case 10\n\nUser story: As a system, the app should ensure all notification content must adhere to data privacy policy, so that Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the students is not exposed.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1.  The push notifications should not expose student's PII.\n2.  The notification content should not violate data privacy guidelines.\n3.  The notifications should comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations.\n"
