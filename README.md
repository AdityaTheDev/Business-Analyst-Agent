# Business Analyst Agent 

A multi-agentic system to streamline tasks typically handled by Business Analysts. 
This system leverages LLMs, Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), and custom tools to generate structured documents like BRDs, use case specifications, Gantt charts, and user manuals — in seconds.

---

## Overview

Business Analysts often spend hours creating repetitive documentation. This project automates and accelerates that workflow using a central Business Analyst Orchestrator Agent coordinating multiple sub-agents.
The system was built as a weekend side project to explore GenAI + multi-agent architectures.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** – Multi-agent orchestration  
- **Gemini 2 Flash Model** – LLM used as the reasoning engine  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive frontend UI  
- **Render** – Deployment platform  
- **Python Libraries** – `openpyxl`, `reportlab`, `pypdf`, and more for document generation

### 3. Usecase and Acceptance Criteria Generated
#### Question : I’m building a feature called Skill Gap Analysis for our SkillLoop platform, which helps users identify the gap between their current skills and the skills required for a specific career goal or job role. The platform should analyze users’ skill profiles (based on assessments or uploaded resumes) and compare them against the skill requirements of their target roles. Based on this, it should recommend personalized learning paths or courses. Please generate detailed use cases along with the acceptance criteria for this feature, covering various user interactions such as uploading skill data, selecting a target role, viewing the gap report, and receiving learning path suggestions

### 4. User Manual Generated
#### Question : I want to generate a user manual for HR admins who use our SkillLoop platform. The manual should explain how they can assign personalized learning plans to employees based on skill gap reports generated by the system. It should include clear instructions on navigating to the skill gap dashboard, selecting an employee, reviewing the gap analysis, and assigning a suitable learning plan. Please include step-by-step guidance, placeholders, tooltips or labels they will see, and best practices. Also mention any prerequisites (like required permissions or completed assessments), and common troubleshooting tips.
