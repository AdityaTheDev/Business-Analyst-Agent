# Business Analyst Agent 

A multi-agentic system to streamline tasks typically handled by Business Analysts. 
This system leverages LLMs, Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), and custom tools to generate structured documents like BRDs, use case specifications, Gantt charts, and user manuals — in seconds.

---

## Overview

Business Analysts often spend hours creating repetitive documentation. This project automates and accelerates that workflow using a central Business Analyst Orchestrator Agent coordinating multiple sub-agents.
The system was built as a weekend side project to explore GenAI + multi-agent architectures.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** – Multi-agent orchestration  
- **Gemini 2 Flash Model** – LLM used as the reasoning engine  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive frontend UI  
- **Render** – Deployment platform  
- **Python Libraries** – `openpyxl`, `reportlab`, `pypdf`, and more for document generation

##  Multiagent Architecture

![System Architecture](Architecture.drawio.png)

The system is powered by a modular multi-agent setup, coordinated by a central orchestrator. Each agent specializes in handling specific Business Analyst tasks.

###  Business Analyst Agent (Main Agent)
The **central brain** of the system. This agent:
- Takes user input from the UI
- Chooses the appropriate sub-agent(s) to invoke
- Ensures flow consistency and handles fallback logic

It acts as the control layer, maintaining conversation context and orchestrating multiple subagents.


###  BRD Generator Agent
Generates a structured **Business Requirement Document** from a given problem statement using its own tool. The output includes:
- Business objective
- In scope & Out of scope
- Stakeholders  
- Success criteria  
- Assumptions and constraints  

### BRD Revision Agent
Allows BRD updates dynamically if user asks to change the generated BRD. Users can specify new inputs or changes, and the agent intelligently revises the original document without losing structure.

### Use Case & Acceptance Criteria Agent
Creates detailed **use cases** and corresponding **acceptance criteria** based on the problem statement using its own tool. This agent is useful for creating diverse usecases and acceptance criteria


### Task Chart Agent
Generates a **task list with dependencies**, durations, and builds a **Gantt chart in Excel** format—helping teams with planning and tracking. It takes task name, start date and end date as input to generate the task chart.

###  User Manual Agent
Drafts a **user manual** from product-related information or use cases. Designed to assist in creating helpful user manuals for end-users.

### 2. BRD Generated
#### Question :  Create a business requirement document for a tool that allows HR to track employee skills, detect skill gaps, and suggest relevant courses using AI.

### 3. Usecase and Acceptance Criteria Generated
#### Question : I’m building a feature called Skill Gap Analysis for our SkillLoop platform, which helps users identify the gap between their current skills and the skills required for a specific career goal or job role. The platform should analyze users’ skill profiles (based on assessments or uploaded resumes) and compare them against the skill requirements of their target roles. Based on this, it should recommend personalized learning paths or courses. Please generate detailed use cases along with the acceptance criteria for this feature, covering various user interactions such as uploading skill data, selecting a target role, viewing the gap report, and receiving learning path suggestions

### 4. User Manual Generated
#### Question : I want to generate a user manual for HR admins who use our SkillLoop platform. The manual should explain how they can assign personalized learning plans to employees based on skill gap reports generated by the system. It should include clear instructions on navigating to the skill gap dashboard, selecting an employee, reviewing the gap analysis, and assigning a suitable learning plan. Please include step-by-step guidance, placeholders, tooltips or labels they will see, and best practices. Also mention any prerequisites (like required permissions or completed assessments), and common troubleshooting tips.
